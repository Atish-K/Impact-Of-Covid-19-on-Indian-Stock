# Impact-Of-Covid-19-on-Indian-Stock
Banking, retail, real estate, and auto are among the worst affected sectors due to coronavirus pandemic, a report said. With the majority of the population staying indoors due to the nationwide lockdown, the economic growth has taken a severe hit resulting in various sectors of the economy facing financial stress. While subdued loan growth has negatively impacted banking, supply side constraints have affected the sectors such as retail and real estate, the report by DSP Investment Managers also said.
Adversely affected Sectors Apparel & Textile will get hit adversely due to disruption in labour supply, raw material unavailability, working capital constraints and restricted demand due to limited movement of people and purchasing ability. Auto sector (which includes automobiles and auto parts) will continue to face challenges on account of lack of demand, global recession and falling income levels. Aviation & Tourism is one sector which has the highest probability of going under without direct government intervention. In the next 12 months, it’s highly unlikely people will travel for leisure apart from very essential travel. Shipping and Non-Food Retail – Non food retail chains and global shipping businesses will find this 12 month period very challenging. Building & Construction businesses are generally leveraged and hence will face the dual challenges of high-interest payments and lack of sales.
